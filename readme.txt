Project Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models consisting of two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator.expand_more The generator's goal is to create new data instances (in this case, images) that resemble the real data distribution.expand_more The discriminator, on the other hand, aims to distinguish between real data (from the training set) and the generated data (fakes) produced by the generator. Through an adversarial training process, the generator progressively improves its ability to generate realistic images, while the discriminator becomes more adept at identifying fakes.expand_more

This project utilizes a GAN architecture for text-to-image synthesis.expand_more It trains a model on the CIFAR-10 image dataset, allowing the generator to learn the underlying image features and relationships. Additionally, it incorporates a text-to-noise conversion technique to map textual descriptions into a noise vector suitable for feeding into the generator. This enables the model to generate images based on the semantic content of the provided text prompts.
Dependencies:The code requires the following Python libraries:

torch: Deep learning framework (https://pytorch.org/)
torchvision: Package for computer vision tasks with PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/vision/)
matplotlib: Python plotting library (https://matplotlib.org/)
tqdm: Progress bar for iterators (https://tqdm.github.io/)
numpy: Numerical computing library (https://numpy.org/)
nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing (https://www.nltk.org/)
Code Structure
The code is organized into several functional blocks:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

Imports necessary libraries like torch and torchvision.
Defines data transformations for the CIFAR-10 dataset, including resizing images to a fixed size, converting them to tensors (numerical representations suitable for deep learning models), and normalizing pixel values.
Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset using torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10 and creates a data loader with shuffling enabled to ensure the model is exposed to a variety of image samples during training.
2. Network Architectures

The project defines two neural network architectures:

a) Generator (netG):

  This network takes a random noise vector as input and aims to generate a corresponding image.expand_more It employs transposed convolutional layers to progressively upscale the feature maps and eventually produce an image with the desired dimensions (typically three channels for RGB images).

The code defines the Generator class that inherits from nn.Module in PyTorch. The __init__ method initializes the network layers using a sequential container (nn.Sequential). The core component is a series of transposed convolutional layers (nn.ConvTranspose2d) with appropriate activation functions (e.g., ReLU) and normalization layers (e.g., BatchNorm2d) for learning image features at different scales. The final layer uses a tanh activation to map the output values between -1 and 1, suitable for representing image pixel intensities.exclamation

b) Discriminator (netD):

  This network takes an image as input and outputs a probability score indicating whether the image is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).exclamation It utilizes convolutional layers with LeakyReLU activations to extract features from the image and a final sigmoid layer to produce the probability score between 0 and 1 (0 for fake, 1 for real).

Similar to the generator, the Discriminator class inherits from nn.Module. It defines a sequential container with convolutional layers, LeakyReLU activations for handling negative inputs, and BatchNorm2d layers. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation to generate the probability output.
3. Hyperparameters 

nz: Dimension of the noise vector fed into the generator. This represents the size of the latent space used to encode textual descriptions.
ngf: Number of filters in the first layer of the generator. It controls the initial feature channel depth and is typically increased as the network progresses to capture more complex image features.
ndf: Number of filters in the first layer of the discriminator. Similar to ngf, it influences the capacity of the discriminator to learn image features.
nc: Number of image channels (typically 3 for RGB images).
lr: Learning rate, which determines the step size used to update the network weights during training.
beta1: Parameter for the Adam optimizer, controlling the exponential decay rate for the first moment estimates.
4. Model Initialization

Creates instances of the generator and discriminator networks using their respective classes.
Applies a weights initialization function (weights_init) (not provided in the code snippet) to set the initial weights of both networks with appropriate methods like Xavier initialization to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients during training.
5. Loss Function and Optimizers

Defines the loss function as Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) for measuring the difference between the discriminator's predictions and the ground truth labels (real or fake).
Creates Adam optimizers for both the generator and discriminator with the specified learning rate and beta values. Adam is an optimization algorithm widely used in deep learning for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling non-convex problems.
6. Training Loop

Sets the number of training epochs (num_epochs), which determines how many times the entire dataset is passed through the network for training.

Iterates through each epoch and data batch:

a) Discriminator Update:

Resets the discriminator's gradients to zero before backpropagation.
Obtains a batch of real images from the data loader.
Generates a label vector of ones (real images).
Passes real images through the discriminator and calculates the loss for real images (wants the discriminator to classify these as real).
Backpropagates the loss to update the discriminator weights in the direction that improves its ability to distinguish real from fake.
Calculates and stores the average discriminator output for real images (D_x), indicating the discriminator's confidence in the real data.
Generates random noise vectors using a standard normal distribution.
Passes fake images (detached from the computational graph to prevent gradients flowing back to the generator) through the discriminator and calculates the loss for fake images (wants the discriminator to classify these as fake).
Backpropagates the loss to update the discriminator weights, strengthening its ability to detect fake images.
Calculates and stores the average discriminator output for fake images after the update (D_G_z1), representing the discriminator's initial confidence in the generated images.
Combines real and fake image losses to get the total discriminator loss (errD), reflecting the overall performance of the discriminator in distinguishing real from fake data.
Updates the discriminator weights using the Adam optimizer.
b) Generator Update:

- Resets the generator's gradients to zero before backpropagation.
- Generates a label vector of ones (since the generator aims to produce images the discriminator classifies as real).
- Passes fake images through the discriminator and calculates the loss for the generator (wants the discriminator to be fooled and classify these as real).
- Backpropagates the loss to update the generator weights in the direction that improves its ability to generate images that can deceive the discriminator.
- Calculates and stores the average discriminator output for fake images after the generator update (`D_G_z2`), indicating the discriminator's confidence in the generated images after the generator's improvement.
- Updates the generator weights using the Adam optimizer.
Prints training progress information every 50 batches, including epoch, batch number, discriminator loss, generator loss, average discriminator outputs for real/fake images after each update. This helps monitor the training process and visualize the competition between the generator and discriminator.
7. Text-to-Noise Conversion:
Defines a function text_to_noise that takes a text prompt and the noise dimension (nz) as input.
Tokenizes the text prompt using nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize to split it into individual words.
Creates a noise tensor with dimensions (1, nz, 1, 1), representing a single noise vector for the current prompt.
Iterates through the tokens:
Uses the hash function to convert each word into a unique numerical value.
Takes the modulo by nz to ensure the value falls within the noise vector's dimension.
Assigns the hashed value to the corresponding position in the noise tensor. This creates a basic embedding where each word in the prompt contributes to the noise vector in a unique way.
8. Image Generation

Defines a function generate_image that takes a text prompt, the generator network (netG), and the noise dimension (nz) as input.
Calls the text_to_noise function to convert the prompt into a noise vector.
Moves the noise tensor to the computation device (CPU in this case) using .to("cpu").
Disables gradient calculation with torch.no_grad() to improve efficiency during image generation (since gradients are not needed for backpropagation in this stage).
Passes the noise vector through the generator network to obtain the generated image.
Detaches the generated image from the computational graph using .detach().cpu().
Converts the generated image tensor to a NumPy array for further processing.
Normalizes the image pixel values between 0 and 1 (assuming the output from the generator uses tanh activation).
Uses plt.imshow to display the generated image.
Removes axis labels and sets the title to the text prompt using plt.axis('off') and plt.title(prompt).
Shows the generated image using plt.show().
Challenges:
1) setup issues to run gpus.
2) Since api use was restricted have to learn how diffusion model works which and then making my own model for it.
3) I was trying if It can description related to image but it do not work sadly.
